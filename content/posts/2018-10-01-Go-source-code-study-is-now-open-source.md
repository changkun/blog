title: Go source code study is open source
---

Since the middle of last month, I started to read the source code of
programming language Go for better understanding its runtime and more.

The entire series are based on Go 1.11 at the moment, and it will continuously
getting support for at least three major release version.

Now, the entire article is open source at GitHub: https://github.com/changkun/go-under-the-hood.
